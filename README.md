## Recommended Usage
The recommended way to work with the notebooks in this repository is through the Google Datablab cloud instance.

To do so,
* Create a Datalab instance using the `--no-create-repository` flag. This flag prevents the instance from setting up a Cloud Source repository, which is a private Git repository hosted on Google Cloud Platform. Use the format:
`datalab create [INSTANCE_NAME] --no-create-repository`
* When created, a browser window opens up the Managed Datalab interface.    
* TODO
